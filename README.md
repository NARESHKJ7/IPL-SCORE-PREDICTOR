# 🏏 IPL Score Predictor
A machine learning-based web app to predict the **final score** of an IPL first innings using match context. Built using **Streamlit**, it uses historical IPL data and regression models like **Random Forest** and **SVM** to predict the outcome in real-time.


## 📌 Features

- Real-time score prediction for T20 matches
- Input match conditions like runs, wickets, overs, etc.
- Uses machine learning models trained on IPL data (2008–17)
- Clean and interactive UI using Streamlit
- Easy to deploy and extend
